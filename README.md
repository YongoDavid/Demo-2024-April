i havent really given the Uderika project time , this week.
My focus has been on Qwasar Uppwork , for software development.
But have built the structure of the admin panel for Uderika to be able to view all emails on the website.
Now i have to host the server for Uderika project and Uderika Amdin to be able to Get and Post these emails properly.
I need to find out why server is hosting but not connecting to Mysql.

April-7
Still trying to figure out hosting my server
i have used mongoDB now , it has hoosted with no errors on (cylic hosting ).
But data is not sending from the client to the server

Testing Uderika Admin demo to get all emails and it is working well.
I am still having issues hosting the main uderika projects server.
