SLOW MOTION IS BETTTER THAN NO MOTION , SOO LETS KEEP GOING NO MATTER WHAT.
THIS IS THE LIFE A CHOOSE.

Need to finish the Uderika project this week.

Then host the Server and do the final testing of the whole project.
And make sure the database is running as it should.

April-2
Form data is now pushing to server and server is sending and updating databse.
Server is 90% done.

April-3
Testing....
Trying to host Server.

April-4
Learning about , how to create an admin panel for (Uderika)
Learnig to be a sofrware developer along side working on a web dev project isnt easy.
The Qwasar sillycon valley platform i am using is challenging but i will pull through.
I just need to make sure i keep going no matter what.

IF I STOP I HAVE LOST AND IF A GIVE UP THATS THE WORST.
STAY LOCKED IN DAVID YOU GOT THIS!

April-5

I need too host uderika main server and try it, maybe it will work

Alpril-6
i havent really given the Uderika project time , this week.
My focus has been on Qwasar Uppwork , for software development.
But have built the structure of the admin panel for Uderika to be able to view all emails on the website.
Now i have to host the server for Uderika project and Uderika Amdin to be able to Get and Post these emails properly.
I need to find out why server is hosting but not connecting to Mysql.

April-7
Still trying to figure out hosting my server
i have used mongoDB now , it has hoosted with no errors on (cylic hosting ).
But data is not sending from the client to the server

April-8
Testing Uderika Admin demo to get all emails and it is working well.
I am still having issues hosting the main uderika projects server.
And because of this i cannot fully test my API to see if there are working , i have to use a demo API to test.

April-9
sadly , i still haven been able to get my hosted server working and saving my data to MongoDB 

April-10
Got a suggestion to try another alternative and that is what i am going to look into.

April-11
Before i try another alternative, i am just going to connect mySQL again and see if it will work.
That is me swtiching now from MongoDB back to mySQL.

April-12
Mysql connected , now its time to host the server again

April-13
i am going to read my code again from begining and try too resolve this issue ine by one.
Till there is no more alternative but to use the test file then i will use the test file.

April-14
Now i am going to try the next option and hopfully the final try at saving and displaying the emails

April-15
The emails are being collected and sent to the textfile.
Also the emails are saving as it should.

April-16
Sending emals to test file is now working.
and the emails can be viewd from the test file through the admin website.

April-17
